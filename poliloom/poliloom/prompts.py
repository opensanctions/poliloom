2. Prefer positions from the same political system/country context
3. Match only when confidence is high - be precise about role equivalence

- Reject if the positions clearly refer to different roles
- Reject if geographic/jurisdictional scope differs significantly

<mapping_objective>
Map the extracted birthplace to the correct Wikidata location entity.
</mapping_objective>

<matching_criteria>
1. Match the most specific location level mentioned in the proof text
   - If proof says "City, Country" → match the city, not the country
   - If proof says only "Country" → match the country

2. Use context from the proof text to disambiguate between similar names
   - Look for parent locations mentioned (district, region, country)
   - These help identify which specific location is meant

3. Account for spelling variations and transliterations
</matching_criteria>

<rejection_criteria>
- Return None if uncertain which candidate matches
- Return None if the location type doesn't match what's described

1. Match the country name with its most common or official form
   - "United States" should match the United States country entity
   - "Germany" should match the Germany country entity
   - "Myanmar" or "Burma" should both match Myanmar country entity

2. Account for historical country names and common variations
   - Match historical forms to current country entities when appropriate
   - Handle aliases and alternative names (e.g., "USA", "America" → "United States")

3. Use context from the proof text to disambiguate
   - Look for additional context that helps identify the specific country

- Return None if uncertain which candidate matches
